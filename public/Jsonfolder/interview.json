It's popular because of its clean syntax that resembles natural English, making it beginner-friendly. Python has extensive libraries for everything from web development to data science, a strong community, and cross-platform compatibility. Companies love it because developers can write code faster and maintain it more easily than with many other languages.</p>"

      {
        "question": "Explain Python's memory management",
        "answer": "<p>Python handles memory automatically through reference counting and garbage collection. When you create an object, Python keeps track of how many variables reference it. When that count drops to zero, the memory is freed. Python also has a cyclic garbage collector to handle circular references. The memory manager organizes memory into pools and blocks for efficiency. As a developer, you rarely need to worry about this, but understanding it helps you write more efficient code.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What are Python decorators and how do you use them?",
        "answer": "<p>Decorators are a way to modify or enhance functions without changing their code directly. They're essentially functions that take another function as input and return a modified version. Here's a simple example:</p>\n          <pre><code>def my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper():\n        print(\"Before function call\")\n        func()\n        print(\"After function call\")\n    return wrapper\n\n\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello():\n    print(\"Hello!\")\n\nsay_hello()\n# Output:\n# Before function call\n# Hello!\n# After function call</code></pre>\n          <p>Decorators are commonly used for logging, authentication, timing functions, and caching.</p>"

        "question": "What's the difference between lists and tuples?",
        "answer": "<p>Lists are mutable (changeable) and use square brackets, while tuples are immutable (unchangeable) and use parentheses. Lists are great when you need to modify data, like adding or removing items. Tuples are perfect for data that shouldn't change, like coordinates or database records. Tuples are also slightly faster and can be used as dictionary keys, while lists cannot.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Explain list comprehensions with examples",
        "answer": "<p>List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Instead of writing loops, you can create lists in one line:</p>\n          <pre><code># Traditional way\nsquares = []\nfor x in range(10):\n    squares.append(x**2)\n\n# List comprehension\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n\n# With condition\neven_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]</code></pre>\n          <p>They're more readable and often faster than traditional loops. You can also use them with if conditions to filter data while creating the list.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What are lambda functions?",
        "answer": "<p>Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions that can have any number of arguments but only one expression. They're useful for short operations that don't warrant a full function definition:</p>\n          <pre><code># Regular function\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n# Lambda equivalent\nadd = lambda x, y: x + y\n\n# Common use with map/filter\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))</code></pre>\n          <p>They're particularly handy with functions like map(), filter(), and sort().</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between shallow and deep copying?",
        "answer": "<p>Shallow copying creates a new object but references the same nested objects, while deep copying creates a completely independent copy of the object and all its nested objects:</p>\n          <pre><code>import copy\n\n\n# Original list with nested objects\noriginal = [1, [2, 3], {'a': 4}]\n\n\n# Shallow copy\nshallow = original.copy()  # or list(original)\nshallow[1][0] = 99  # This affects the original!\n\n\n# Deep copy\ndeep = copy.deepcopy(original)\ndeep[1][0] = 99  # This doesn't affect the original</code></pre>\n          <p>Use shallow copies when you only need a new container but don't mind sharing nested objects. Use deep copies when you need complete independence.</p>"

        "question": "Explain Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)",
        "answer": "<p>The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. This means Python threads can't truly run in parallel for CPU-bound tasks, only for I/O-bound tasks.</p>\n          <p><strong>Why it exists:</strong> Simplifies memory management and makes Python easier to implement correctly.</p>\n          <p><strong>Impact:</strong> CPU-bound programs don't benefit from threading, but I/O-bound programs do. For CPU-bound tasks, use multiprocessing instead of threading.</p>\n          <p><strong>Future:</strong> Python 3.12+ has made the GIL optional, and there are ongoing efforts to remove it entirely.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What are Python generators and when should you use them?",
        "answer": "<p>Generators are functions that use the <strong>yield</strong> keyword to return values one at a time, maintaining their state between calls. They're memory-efficient for large datasets:</p>\n          <pre><code># Regular function (loads all numbers into memory)\ndef get_numbers_list(n):\n    return [i for i in range(n)]\n\n# Generator (yields one number at a time)\ndef get_numbers_generator(n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        yield i\n\n# Usage\nfor num in get_numbers_generator(1000000):  # Memory efficient\n    print(num)</code></pre>\n          <p>Use generators when working with large datasets, infinite sequences, or when you only need to process items one at a time.</p>"

Imagine you run a coffee shop and want to know why sales dropped last month. A data scientist would look at all your data - customer visits, weather patterns, local events, competitor pricing - and find patterns to explain what happened and predict what might happen next.</p>\n<p>It combines statistics, programming, and business knowledge to extract meaningful insights from data.

It's like a student who memorizes practice test answers but can't solve new problems. The model performs perfectly on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs of overfitting:</strong> Large gap between training and validation accuracy, model performs much worse on test data than expected.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention strategies:</strong> Use more training data, simplify your model (fewer features or parameters), apply regularization techniques (L1/L2), use cross-validation, implement early stopping, and add dropout layers in neural networks.

                "answer": "<p>The Central Limit Theorem is one of the most important concepts in statistics. It states that when you take many samples from any population and calculate their means, those sample means will be normally distributed, regardless of the original population's distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>\n<ul className=\"list-disc pl-6 space-y-1\">\n  <li>Works with any distribution (uniform, skewed, bimodal)</li>\n  <li>Larger sample sizes make the approximation better</li>\n  <li>The mean of sample means equals the population mean</li>\n  <li>Standard error decreases as sample size increases</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It's the foundation for confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and many statistical procedures. It explains why we can make inferences about populations from samples, even when we don't know the population's exact distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical example:</strong> Even if individual customer purchase amounts are highly skewed, the average purchase amount across many customers will be approximately normally distributed.</p>"

                "question": "What's the difference between parametric and non-parametric tests?",
                "answer": "<p>Parametric tests make assumptions about the underlying data distribution (usually normal) and estimate parameters of that distribution. They're like having a specific recipe - you assume certain ingredients (assumptions) are present.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong> t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression</p>\n<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Normality, equal variances, independence</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> More powerful when assumptions are met, well-understood</p>\n<p>Non-parametric tests make no assumptions about the underlying distribution. They're like being a flexible cook who can work with whatever ingredients are available.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman correlation</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Robust to outliers, work with any distribution, fewer assumptions</p>\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Generally less powerful, may require larger sample sizes</p>\n<p><strong>When to choose:</strong> Use parametric tests when assumptions are reasonably met and you have sufficient sample size. Use non-parametric tests when data is highly skewed, has outliers, or when sample sizes are small.</p>"

                "answer": "<p>Imbalanced datasets are common in real-world problems (fraud detection, medical diagnosis, spam classification). Here's how to handle them:</p>\n<p><strong>Resampling techniques:</strong></p>\n<ul className=\"list-disc pl-6 space-y-1\">\n  <li>Oversampling: Create more examples of minority class (SMOTE, ADASYN)</li>\n  <li>Undersampling: Remove examples from majority class</li>\n  <li>Combined approaches: Mix over and undersampling</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Algorithm-level approaches:</strong></p>\n<ul className=\"list-disc pl-6 space-y-1\">\n  <li>Cost-sensitive learning: Assign higher costs to misclassifying minority class</li>\n  <li>Threshold adjustment: Change decision threshold based on class distribution</li>\n  <li>Ensemble methods: Use algorithms designed for imbalanced data</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Evaluation considerations:</strong> Don't use accuracy alone - focus on precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-PR. Always consider the business cost of different types of errors.</p>\n<p><strong>Best practices:</strong> Understand your domain, try multiple approaches, use stratified sampling for train-test splits, and validate on realistic test sets.</p>"

You reduce the number of variables while keeping as much information as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Common techniques:</strong></p>\n<ul className=\"list-disc pl-6 space-y-1\">\n  <li>PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Finds directions of maximum variance</li>\n  <li>t-SNE: Great for visualization, preserves local structure</li>\n  <li>UMAP: Newer technique, often better than t-SNE</li>\n  <li>Feature selection: Remove irrelevant or redundant features</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>When to use:</strong></p>\n<ul className=\"list-disc pl-6 space-y-1\">\n  <li>High-dimensional data (curse of dimensionality)</li>\n  <li>Visualization of complex data</li>\n  <li>Noise reduction</li>\n  <li>Computational efficiency</li>\n  <li>Storage space limitations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Considerations:</strong> You lose interpretability, need to explain variance retained, and some techniques are better for visualization than modeling.
